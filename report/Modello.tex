	This document presents our mathematical model for predicting the evapotranspiration of the lettuce inside a simplified cubic cell.\\
	This is only a sketch that, one day (hopefully soon), will become the basis of the report for this project.\\
	The document is divided into three chapters, each one reporting the equations of our interest from one out of the three papers we have used to build the model.\\
	Since this is only a sketch and not for diffusion, papers are not quoted yet, neither are the other papers quoted inside them; we refer to each paper using the name of the author: this is clear enough at the moment.\\
	Of course we will provide to include a references list and to quote properly each source.\\
